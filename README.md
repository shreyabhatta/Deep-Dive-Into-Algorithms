# Deep-Dive-Into-Algorithms

Our aim is to learn some basic and advanced algorithms which are used in computer science. We will mainly use competitive programming platforms such as codeforces to familiarise different problems which can be solved using various algorithms. We will focus on the implementation part which is required for Competitive Programming. A broad focus for this is to give a basic introduction to CP.
